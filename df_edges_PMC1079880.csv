The plasma concentrations of cladribine,by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography,0.9256263201643982,"The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the population distribution of pharmacokinetic parameters in patients undergoing treatment with cladribine and to detect the influence of different covariates on the pharmacokinetic parameters.MethodsThis pharmacokinetic study presents the results of a retrospective population pharmacokinetic analysis based on pooled data from 161 patients, who were given cladribine in different administration routes in various dosing regimens. The plasma concentrations of cladribine were determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using a solid phase extraction with a limit of quantitation of 1 nM using 1 mL of plasma.ResultsA three compartment structural model best described the disposition of cladribine.
